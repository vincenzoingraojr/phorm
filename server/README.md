# Phorm | Server

This is the back-end of the project, and will be used not only by the mobile apps, but also by the web app. It's an Express server that leverages the power of the Apollo Server technology, so it allows me to create a single back-end to be used by multiple clients. The entire back-end is written in TypeScript.

## How to start the local back-end development

To start the development server properly, follow these instructions:

-   Run `yarn` to install all of the dependencies
-   Create a `.env` file in the root of the `server` folder
-   Copy the content of the existent `.env.example` file inside the `.env` file
-   Assign a value to the environment variables you find inside the `.env` file. It's usually done this way:

    ```
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=4000
    CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname[?paramspec]
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=[your access token secret]
    REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=[your refresh token secret]
    // set the remaining environment variables from the .env.example file
    ```

-   Run `yarn dev`

Now you can start the local front-end development. As for the email services, you can configure the back-end to work with other methods as well.
